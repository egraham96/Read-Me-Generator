# Homework Assignment 9-ReadMe Generator

## Description:
This week's homework required us to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the NPM Inquirer package. The application will be invoked by using the node index.js in the user's command line. The ReadME.md file generated by this application adheres to the standards of the Professional ReadMe guide and consists of the following sections: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Installation Instructions:
